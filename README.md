# About

This project is an inspiration of previous mini-games I've played, and motivated to production because I wanted to have a space where I could enjoy personalised mini-games with friends outside while waiting (e.g. queuing for food).

## Documentation

This page is still on a WIP. Multiplayer features for game of 3D coming soon. 
More games will be added once multiplayer support has been fine-tuned.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Deployment

This project is deployed on Heroku.
